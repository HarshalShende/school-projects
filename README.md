# school-projects

Showcase of some interesting projects I've done during college.

This repo has three purposes:

- allow me to take a trip down the memory lane
- answer the question _what am I going to do at college?_ for students interested in this faculty
- enable anyone curious to take a look at what I've done



## About the projects

Each project has a one-line description and an accompanying screenshot (or gif).

The [link](https://github.com/stefan1niculae/school-projects) mentions the project's language and points to its source.

A flag ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ indicates that the project is written in romanian.



I have included both projects with an interesting outcome, and ones that are stand out through their implementation.

Earlier projects may not seem as impressive â€” their TODO



## About the classes

Classes are presented chronologically and grouped by semester. Each class features one or two significant projects.

**Bachelor's** lasted 6 semesters (three years) and **Master's** â€”Â 4 semesters (two years).



Some classes naturally lend themselves more to visualization (i.e: Computer Graphics).

Some tend to be too theoretical/mathematical:

* Mathematical and Computational Logic _(semester 1)_
* Mathematical Analysis/Calculus _(semesters 1 & 2)_
* (Linear) Algebra _(semesters 1 & 2)_
* Calculability & Complexity *(semester 3)*
* Logic Programming *(semester 4)*
* Partial Derivatives and Differential Equations *(semester 5)*
* Declarative Programming *(semester 6)*
* (Mathematical) Optimization Techniques *(semester 6)*
* Numerical Analysis *(semester 6)*

Some are just not too visual:

* Psychopedagogy *(semesters 1 - 4)*
* Databases *(semester 4)*
* Database Management Systems *(semester 5)*

And, unfortunately, cannot be showcased in this format, as a screenshot and one-liner won't do them justice.



Some classes required bigger projects â€”Â they each get a separate repo:

* Software Development Methodologies *(semester 4)* â€“ [Senile de Foc](https://github.com/stefan1niculae/senile-de-foc)
* Web Development *(semester 5)* â€“ [Blacksmith](https://github.com/stefan1niculae/blacksmith)
* Software Engineering *(semester 6)* â€“ [EasyVim](https://github.com/stefan1niculae/easyVim)
