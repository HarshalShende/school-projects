A few interesting projects I've done during college




### Pretty AVL Tree
**[C++]**
_Year 1, Semester 1, Algorithms & Data Structures class._ 
One of the first 'serious' data structure implementations I've made. It also displays the tree in an ASCII graphical interface.

### Graph Isomorphism
**[C++]**
_Year 1, Semester 2, Graph Theory class._ 
Backtracking solution (the only non heuristic one existing) to check whether two given graphs are essentially the same.

### Hungarian Algorithm
**[C++]**
_Year 1, Semester 2, Graph Theory class._ 
Implementation of the hungarian algorithm using bipartite graph matchings and covering.

### Context free Grammar to Chomsky normal Form
**[C++]**
_Year 1, Semester 2, Formal Languages and Automata class._ 
Any CFG can be converted into CNF. And this program is here to prove it in 5 steps (plus a 6th one for easier reading).

### Deterministic Finite Automaton Minimization
**[C++]**
_Year 1, Semester 2, Formal Languages and Automata class._ 
Another theorem turned into reality: step by step minimization of a DFA.


### Fields
**[C++]**
_Year 1, Semester 2, Object Oriented Programming class._ 
Mathematical Fields over N, Z, R, C, Zn or a carthesian product of those with custom composition rules. Also includes an expression parser.

### Big Numbers
**[C++]**
_Year 1, Semester 2, Object Oriented Programming class._ 
Can store real numbers up to ULL_MAX^ULL_MAX where ULL_MAX = 2^64 - 1. Also supports the standard operations upon them.

### Hamming Code
**[C#]**
_Year 2, Semester 1, Computer Networks class._ 
Sends an arbitrarily large string coded using the appropriate Hamming Code. Also decodes it upon receival.

### Intro in the S language
**[Standard Language]**
_Year 2, Semester 1, Computability and Complexity class._ The theory behind the Turing machine is that there can be a language that consists only of four type of instructions (three even) that can do absolutely everything any modern computer can do. And this program is here to show some examples.

### Visual Triangulation
**[Java]**
_Year 2, Semester 1, Computational Geometry class._ Triangulation of a set of points that includes a GUI and step-by-step evolution.

### Word Count
**[C]**
_Year 2, Semester 1, Operating Systems class._ Simulates the Word Count Unix command. May I say it does it even better than the orginial.


### Tired Explorer
**[Java]**
_Year 2, Semester 2, Advanced Programming Techiques._ Step by step evolution of a climber that can has to traverse an area of different heights and must do so with the least effort possible.
