# school-projects

Showcase of some interesting projects I've done during college.

The purpose of this repo is to allow me to fondly remember college times with ease. It is also open for anyone to take a look :)



## About the classes

Bachelor's lasted 3 years (two semesters each) and Master's â€“ 2 years (two semesters each). The *italicized* number after the name of a class is the semester I attended it in.

Some classes/disciplines naturally lend themselves more to visualization (i.e: Computational Graphics).

Some tend to be too theoretical/mathematical:

* Mathematical and Computational Logic _(1)_
* Mathematical Analysis/Calculus _(1 & 2)_
* (Linear) Algebra _(1 & 2)_
* Logic Programming *(4)*
* Partial Derivatives and Differential Equations *(5)*
* Declarative Programming *(6)*
* (Mathematical) Optimization Techniques *(6)*

Some are just not too visual:

* Psychopedagogy *(1 - 4)*
* Databases *(4)*
* Database Management Systems *(5)*

And finally, some classes required bigger projects â€“Â which received a repo all by themselves:

* Software Development Methodologies *(4)* â€“ [Senile de Foc](https://github.com/stefan1niculae/senile-de-foc)
* Web Development *(5)* â€“ [Blacksmith](https://github.com/stefan1niculae/blacksmith)
* Software Engineering *(6)* â€“ [EasyVim](https://github.com/stefan1niculae/easyVim)



## About the projects

As I attended college in Romania, (parts of) some projects are written in romanian â€“Â signaled with a flag  ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´.

I will include one/two screenshots, or a gif, if appropriate, for each project.

The name inside [brackets] is the (main) language of the project.

## Semester 1

## Semester 2

## Semester 3

### Statistics and Probabilities

#### Does Money Come with Age? ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´

Statistical exploration of wether income correlates with age. [R]

### Computer Graphics

#### Triangulation

Checks wether a given point is inside (or on an edge)  a shape via triangulation. [Java]

## Semester 4

### Web Techniques

#### Time Flies

Simple game done in vanilla html, js & css. The idea is to catch as many hourglasses as you can. The more you catch, the faster they come (launched in a random direction). [JavaScript]

## Semester 5

### (System) Simulation Techniques

#### Store Planning Improvement ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´

Simulation for a real food store with the goal of improving lunch-time customer flow. [GPSS]
